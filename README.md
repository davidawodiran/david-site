# David Site

Modern personal website built with **Next.js + React**.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- Plain CSS (`app/globals.css`)

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- `legacy-index.html` is kept as a reference snapshot of the previous static version.
- The current implementation avoids newly introduced binary assets in the migrated UI PR.
